    Detects peaks in two brightness arrays, compares their shapes, and applies filtering if needed.
    Allows the user to force filtering even if the shapes match or mismatch.

    Parameters:
        - inputpath (str): Path to the input data containing the brightness arrays.
        - factor (int): Block averaging factor for peak detection.
        - threshold (int or None): Threshold for peak detection. If None, it will be calculated.
